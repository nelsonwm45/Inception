# Meaning: This header tells MariaDB that the settings below apply to the
# server daemon (mysqld) itself, not the client tools.
[mysqld]

# Meaning: Defines the directory where the actual database files are stored.
# Needed: Matches the volume mount in docker-compose.yaml. This ensures
# 	your data persists (survives) even if the container is deleted.
datadir = /var/lib/mysql

# PARAMETER: Unix Socket
# Meaning: Defines the file used for local communication (processes on the
# 	same container talking to the DB without using a network port).
# 	Needed: Required for the 'mysqladmin shutdown' command in your setup script.
socket  = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

# PARAMETER: Bind Address (CRITICAL FOR DOCKER)
# Meaning: '0.0.0.0' tells MariaDB to listen for connections on ALL available
# 	network interfaces.
# Needed: By default, MariaDB listens on '127.0.0.1' (localhost only).
# If you don't change this, WordPress (which is on a different container/IP)
# 	will get "Connection Refused" when trying to connect.
bind_address = 0.0.0.0

# PARAMETER: Network Port
# Meaning: The standard TCP/IP port for MySQL/MariaDB traffic.
# Needed: Explicitly sets the port so WordPress knows where to connect.
port = 3306

# PARAMETER: System User
# Meaning: Runs the MariaDB process as the 'mysql' user, not 'root'.
# Needed: A mandatory security standard. If the DB is compromised, the
# 	attacker only gets 'mysql' privileges, not full 'root' access to the container.
user = mysql
